# Hello
These are supposed to be physics and chemistry notes. People decided they wanted copies for themselves. So here, knock yourselves out.

I'm afraid that I'm going to dodge all responsibility for the inaccuracy of these notes, however, if you do find any mistakes in them, please tell me and I'll see if:
1. You're correct, and
2. I can be bothered to correct them.
