## Temperature

* Temperature is a measure of the "hotness" of an object.
* Related to the internal kinetic energy of the molecules of a substance.
* Determines the direction of transfer of "heat" from hot to cold.



#### Scales of Temperature

**°C** - Celcius

**K** - kelvin (absolute scale of temperature)

**K = °C + 273.15**



#### Absolute Zero

Absolute zero is the minimum possible temperature, where internal kinetic energy becomes zero.

![Volume of gas against absolute temperature graph](http://dev.physicslab.org/img/4014c19d-8ade-4919-bf81-49cbd20c304c.gif)



#### Internal Energy

The internal energy of an object is the sum of the random distribution of the **potential** and the **kinetic** energies of its molecules.

* **Potential energy** is based on the physical bonds between molecules within the substance.
* **Kinetic energy** is the energy of the molecules moving.
* Adding more energy changes the physical state of the object.



The internal energy of an object may be **increased** by:

* Energy transfer by heating the object;
* Work done on the object, eg by electricity.

Internal energy may stay **constant** because:

* There is no energy transfer by heating and no work is done on the object;
* Energy transfer by heating and work done *by* the object balance out each other.



## Specific Heat Capacity

**Specific Heat Capacity**: The energy needed to raise the temperature of unit mass of the substance by 1K without change of state.

#### Equation

$\LARGE  \bbox[10px, border:5px solid purple]{\Delta Q = mc \Delta T}$

* $\Delta Q​$ is the change in energy (**J**)
* $m$ is the mass of the object (**kg**)
* $c$ is the specific heat capacity of the object (**J kg^-1^ K^-1^**)
* $\Delta T​$ is the change in temperature (**K**)

The specific heat capacity of water = 4.18 J kg^-1^ K^-1^



#### The Inversion Tube Experiment

![Inversion Tube Experiment](C:\Users\hamis\OneDrive\Documents\School\Physics\Revision\img\Inversion Tube Experiment.png)

* In the inversion tube experiment, the gravitational potential energy of a lead shot is converted into internal energy when it hits the bottom of the tube.

* The tube is inverted multiple times and the final and initial temperatures are measured.

* The specific heat capacity of lead is then able to be calculated using:

  ​	$\large c = \dfrac{gLn}{\Delta T}$	

  * $c$ is the specific heat capacity;
  * $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity;
  * $L$ is the length of the tube;
  * $n​$ is the number of inversions;
  * $\Delta T​$ is the change in temperature.



#### An Electrical Method for Measuring Specific Heat Capacity

![](C:\Users\hamis\OneDrive\Documents\School\Physics\Revision\img\Simple solid block calorimeter - specific heat capacity experiment.png)

* In this experiment, a metal block is heated by the heater, causing its temperature to rise, which is measured by the thermometer.

* Grease should be applied between the heater and the block, and the thermometer and the block, to improve thermal contact.

* The electrical energy supplied, $Q​$ = heater current $I \times​$ heater pd $V \times​$ heating time $t​$

* So, assuming no heat loss to the surroundings, $mc \Delta T = IVt$

  $\Large \therefore c = \dfrac{IVt}{m \Delta T}$ 



#### Measuring the Specific Heat Capacity of Liquids

![](C:\Users\hamis\OneDrive\Documents\School\Physics\Revision\img\Specific heat capacity of a liquid experiment.png)

* In this experiment, the liquid is heated in a calorimeter, with the temperature change measured, pd and current measured.

* Since Energy input = change in energy of the system:

  $\large IVt = m_l c_l \Delta T_l + m_c c_c \Delta T_c$

  * $m_l$ and $c_l​$ are the mass of the liquid and specific heat capacity of the liquid, respectively.
  * $m_c$ and $c_c$ are the mass of the liquid and specific heat capacity of the calorimeter, respectively.

* This equation is able to be arranged for $c_l$, and since all other quantities are know, the specific heat capacity of the liquid is able to be calculated.



#### Continuous Flow Heating

* For a system such as an electrical shower, the water is continuously heated.

* Therefore:

  $\large P = \dfrac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t} = \dfrac{mc \Delta T}{\Delta t}​$



## Changes of State

![Temperature against time for a pure substance being heated](https://www.edplace.com/userfiles/image/Energy%20Changes%203078%20Intro.jpg)

When a substance is heated, its temperature changes in accordance with the graph above.



#### Latent Heat of Fusion

* When a solid is heated when it is at its melting point, the energy that is inputted is used to weaken the bonds between the molecules until it becomes a liquid.
* The energy required to to melt a solid at its melting point is called the **latent heat of fusion**.



#### Latent Heat of Vaporisation

* When a liquid is heated when it is at its boiling point, the energy that is inputted is used to break the bonds between the molecules until it becomes a gas.
* The energy required to vaporise a liquid at its boiling point is called the **latent heat of vaporisation**.



#### Calculating Latent Heat

**Specific heat of fusion**: The energy needed to change the state of unit mass of the substance from solid to liquid without change of temperature.

**Specific heat of vaporisation**: The energy needed to change the state of unit mass of the substance from liquid to vapour without change of temperature.

* To calculate the energy needed to melt or vaporise a solid or liquid:

  $\Large Q = ml$

  * $Q$ is the energy required (**J**).
  * $m$ is the mass of the substance (**kg**).
  * $l$ is the specific latent heat of fusion or vaporisation (**J kg^-1^**).



> #### Specifying what 'specific' is
>
> In science, 'specific' means **per unit** mass or volume.
>
> Generally, 'specific' quantities have **lower case symbols**. Upper case symbols are used when a quantity is not specific.
>
> ​	eg. $l$ is the specific latent heat of fusion or vaporisation.
>
> ​	     $L​$ is 'just' the latent heat of fusion or vaporisation.



## The Experimental Gas Laws



#### Boyle's Law

For a constant mass of gas at absolute temperature, the pressure exerted by a gas on its container is inversely proportional ot the volume it occupies.

$\huge  \bbox[10px, border:5px solid purple]{p \propto \dfrac{1}{V}} \; \; \text{   or   }  \; \;  \bbox[10px, border:5px solid purple]{pV = \text{constant}} $

![Boyle's Law at different temperatures graph](https://hemantmore.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Boyles-Law-01-300x286.png)



#### Charles' Law

For a constant mass of gas at a constant pressure, the volume occupied by a gas is proportional to its absolute temperature.

$\huge  \bbox[10px, border:5px solid purple]{V \propto T}​$

![Image result for charles' law graph](https://cramster-image.s3.amazonaws.com/definitions/DC-823v1.png)



#### The Pressure Law (Gay-Lussac's Law)

For a constant mass of gas at constant volume, the pressure exerted by a gas is proportional to its absolute temperature.

$\huge  \bbox[10px, border:5px solid purple]{p \propto T}$

![Image result for gay lussac's law graph](http://chemistry-reference.com/gases/Gay-Lussac's%20Law%20graph.gif)



## The Ideal Gas Law

Combining Boyle's, Charles' and Gay-Lussac's laws:

$\large \dfrac{pV}{T} = \text{constant}$

Since equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure contain the same number of moles, the **ideal gas law** can be formed:

$\huge  \bbox[10px, border:5px solid purple]{pV = nRT}​$

* $p​$ is the pressure of the gas (**Pa**);
* $V$ is volume of gas (**m^3^**);
* $n$ is the number of moles in the gas (**mol**);
* $R$ is the molar gas constant, $R$ **= 8.31 J mol^-1^ K^-1^**
* $T​$ is the absolute temperature of the gas (**K**).



**Alternatively**:

$\huge \bbox[10px, border:5px solid purple]{pV = NkT}$

* $N$ is the number of molecules in the gas;
* $k$ is the Boltzman Constant, $k$ **= 1.38×10^-23^ J K^-1^**.
* $\large k = \dfrac{R}{N_A}$ where $N_A$ is Avogadro's constant.



## The Kinetic Theory of Gases

#### Molecular Speeds

Molecules in a gas are in continual random motion. As they are moving in all directions within a container, if we took the mean of their velocities, we would get zero. So, instead, we use the **root mean squared** speed, **c~rms~**.

For N molecules in a gas,
$$
\LARGE{ c_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{ \dfrac{{c_1}^2 + {c_2}^2 + {c_3}^2 + \ldots + {c_n}^2} {N}}}
$$


where $c_1​$, $c_2​$, etc represent the speeds of the individual molecules.



#### Ideal Gas

To derive the kinetic theory equation, certain assumptions need to be made.

The key assumptions are:

1. **The molecules are point molecules.** The volume of each molecule is negligible compared with the volume of the gas.
2. **There are no intermolecular forces (the molecules do not attract each other).** If they did, the effect would reduce the force of their impacts on the container surface. (The gas also can't turn into a liquid as there is no internal potential energy - only kinetic).
3. **The molecules move about in continual random motion.**
4. **The collisions the molecules undergo with each other and with the container are elastic collisions** (ie there is no overall loss of kinetic energy in a collision).
5. **Each collision with the container surface is of much shorter duration than the time between impacts.**



#### Deriving the Equation

![](C:\Users\hamis\OneDrive\Documents\School\Physics\Revision\img\Gas in a box.png)



Consider one molecule, of mass $\large m$, in a cuboid box of sides $\large l_x$, $\large l_y$ and $\large l_z$. The velocity components for *molecule 1* (in red) are $\large u$, $\large v$ and $\large w$ in the x, y and z directions respectively.

We can use Pythagoras' Theorem to show:
$$
\Large {c_1}^2 = {c_1}^2 + {v_1}^2 + {w_1}^2
$$


If we consider the impact of molecule 1 with the shaded face, the change in momentum is:

![](C:\Users\hamis\OneDrive\Documents\School\Physics\Revision\img\kinetic gases momentum.png)
$$
\Large{
\Delta p = p_\text{final} - p_\text{initial} \\
\Delta p = -mu_1 -(mu_1) \\
\underline{\Delta p = -2mu_1}
}
$$


The time interval before the same molecule with the shaded face is:
$$
\Large \text{time} = \dfrac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \dfrac{2l_x}{u_1}
$$
(The distance is $\large 2l_x$ because the molecule must travel there and back).



Therefore, the number of collisions per unit time is:
$$
\Large t^{-1} = \dfrac{u_1}{2l_x}
$$


From Newton's Second Law, the resultant force is the rate of change of momentum with respect to time. The force exerted by the molecule on the shaded face is therefore the rate at which the molecule transfers momentum to the face.

From Newton's Third Law, the force exerted by the molecule on the face is equal and opposite to the force exerted by the face on the molecule.

The force on the molecule is:
$$
\Large{
	\eqalign{
        F &= \dfrac{\Delta p}{t} \\
        \therefore F &= -2mu \times \dfrac{u_1}{2l_x} = \dfrac{2m{u_1}^2}{2l_x} \\
        F &= -\dfrac{m{u_1}^2}{l_x}
	}
}
$$


The force the molecule exerts on the face, $F_1​$, is:
$$
\Large{
	\eqalign{
        F_1 &= -F \\
        \implies F_1 &= \dfrac{m{u_1}^2}{l_x}
    }
}
$$


The pressure exerted by molecule 1 on the face is $p_1 = \dfrac{F_1}{A}$.

The area of the shaded face is base × height ($=l_x \times l_y​$).
$$
\Large{
    \implies p_1 = \dfrac{m{u_1}^2}{l_x l_y l_z}
}
$$
$\large l_x l_y l_z$ is the volume of the box, V:
$$
\Large{    \implies p_1 = \dfrac{m{u_1}^2}{V}}
$$


Now consider all of the molecules moving in the x direction. The total pressure exerted will be the sum of all the individual pressures from each molecule.
$$
\Large{
    \eqalign{
        p &= p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + \ldots + p_N \\
        \implies p &= \dfrac{m{u_1}^2}{V} + \dfrac{m{u_2}^2}{V} + \dfrac{m{u_3}^2}{V} + \ldots + \dfrac{m{u_N}^2}{V}
    }
}
$$


If we define the mean speed squared, $\large \bar{u}^2$ as:
$$
\Large{
    \eqalign{
        \bar{u}^2 &= \dfrac{{u_1}^2 + {u_2}^2 + {u_3}^2 + \ldots + {u_N}^2}{N} \\
        \text{and }p &=\dfrac{m ({u_1}^2 + {u_2}^2 + {u_3}^2 + \ldots + {u_N}^2)}{V} \\
        \implies p &= \dfrac{Nm \bar{u}^2}{V}
    }
}
$$


As discussed earlier, $\large {c_1}^2 = {c_1}^2 + {v_1}^2 + {w_1}^2$, and:
$$
\Large{
    \eqalign{
        {c_\text{rms}}^2 &= \dfrac{{c_1}^2 + {c_2}^2 + {c_3}^2 + \ldots + {c_N}^2}{N} \\ \\
        
        \implies {c_\text{rms}}^2 &= \dfrac{{u_1}^2 + {v_1}^2 + {w_1}^2 + {u_2}^2 + {v_2}^2 + {w_2}^2 + \ldots}{N} \\ \\
        
        \implies {c_\text{rms}}^2 &= \dfrac{{u_1}^2 + {u_2}^2}{N} + \dfrac{{v_1}^2 + {v_2}^2}{N} + \dfrac{{w_1}^2 + {w_2}^2}{N} \\ \\
        
        \implies {c_\text{rms}}^2 &= \bar{{u}_1}^2 + \bar{{v}_1}^2 + \bar{{w}_1}^2
    }
}
$$


If there is a large number of molecules and they are in continual random motion, then:
$$
\Large{
    \eqalign{
        \bar{{u}}^2 &= \bar{{v}}^2 = \bar{{w}}^2 \\ \\
        
        \implies {c_\text{rms}}^2 &= 3 \bar{u}^2 \; \large{\text{ and }} \Large \; \bar{u}^2 = \dfrac{1}{3} {c_\text{rms}}^2 \\ \\
        
        \large{\text{From }} \Large p &= \dfrac{Nm \bar{u}^2}{V}, \\ \\
        
        p &= \dfrac{Nm \: {c_\text{rms}}^2}{3V} \\ \\
        
            
        
    }
}
$$

$$
\bbox[15px, border:5px solid purple]{\Huge pV = \Huge \dfrac{1}{3}Nm \: {c_\text{rms}}^2}
$$





## Mean Kinetic Energy

The mean kinetic energy of a molecule of gas:
$$
\Large{
    \eqalign{
       \text{mean kinetic energy of molecule} &= \dfrac{\text{total kinetic energy of all molecules}}{N} \\ \\
       
       &= \dfrac{ \dfrac{1}{2} m {c_1}^2 + \dfrac{1}{2} m {c_2}^2 + \ldots + \dfrac{1}{2} m {c_N}^2}{N} \\ \\
       
       &= \dfrac{1}{2}m \left( \dfrac{{c_1}^2 + {c_2}^2 + \ldots + {c_N}^2}{N}\right) \\ \\
       
       &= \bbox[15px, border:5px solid purple]{ \Huge \dfrac{1}{2}m {c_\text{rms}}^2}
       
    }
}
$$
Where $\large m​$ is the mass of one molecule.



Furthermore:
$$
\Large{
    \begin{align}

            pV &= \dfrac{1}{3}Nm \: {c_\text{rms}}^2  \tag{1} \\ \\

            \large \text{Mean kinetic energy of one molecule } &= \dfrac{1}{2}m {c_\text{rms}}^2 \tag{2} \\ \\
            
            pV &= NkT \tag{3}
            
  \end{align}  
}
$$



$$
\Large{
	\begin{align}
	
        \large (3) = (1) \implies \Large \dfrac{1}{3}Nm \: {c_\text{rms}}^2 &= NkT \\ \\
        
         \dfrac{1}{3} m \: {c_\text{rms}}^2 &= kT \quad \large\times \dfrac{3}{2}
         
	\end{align} \\ \\
         
         
        
        
}
$$

$$
\Large{
    \qquad \qquad \qquad \bbox[15px, border:5px solid purple]{\huge \dfrac{1}{3} m \: {c_\text{rms}}^2 = \dfrac{3}{2}kT}
}
$$
